# Excel-Samples-Bike-Purchases
This interactive dataset offers comprehensive demographic and behavioural data about specific consumers in three (3) regions (Europe, North-America and Pacific) in September 2021, with the aim of examining the variables that affect bicycle sales. 
It includes information about the individual's age, gender, income, marital status, education, occupation, number of children, home and car ownership, commuting distance, region and whether or not the individual purchased the bike or not.  
This dataset is perfect for analyzing consumer behavior and creating prediction models to find potential bike buyers.

 ANALYSIS
Professionals and individuals in management roles report the highest average income levels with professionals reaching over $100,000 annually, while manual workers earn significantly less.  Income, however, is not a reliable indicator of bike purchasing behavior. In spite of their often modest earnings, clerical workers, for example, bought the most bikes, followed by manual laborers. This implies that factors other than affordability are also involved in determining what people decide to buy.

The number of cars owned and bike ownership trends have an inverse relationship.  The majority of bike purchases were made by those without vehicles, and as car ownership rose, the number of purchases gradually declined.  This demonstrates how future efforts could target people without cars or those with restricted access to them.

In terms of age, the average income of older people is the highest, while that of adolescents is the lowest.  Younger and middle-aged consumers continue to make purchases despite the income gap, perhaps due to lifestyle choices and transportation requirements more than just income.

According to gender analysis, although the difference is not significant, male customers bought a little more motorcycles than female customers. 

And lastly, Convenience and practicality are powerful motivators, as seen by the fact that those who commute the smallest distances—particularly 0–1 miles—are the most likely to buy bikes.

These are the reports from North America and the Pacific region
